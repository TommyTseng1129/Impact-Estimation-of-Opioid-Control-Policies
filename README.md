# Impact Estimation of Opioid Control Policies

## 1. Motivation

Opioid abuse and overdoses have rocked the United Statesfor the past two decades. The number of opioid overdose deaths has quadrupled since 1999, and more than half a million people died from drug overdoses from 2000 to 2015. Recently, opioid abuse has even contributed to a 2014-2017 decline in male life expectancy, leading the President to declare a national opioid health emergency in 2017. 

In response to the opioid epidemic, states have implemented policies with the goal of decreasing opioid prescriptions, addictions, and deaths. This analysis examines three states specific states that enacted stricter opioid regulations between 2007 and 2012 – Florida, Texas, and Washington. Their regulatory policies all sought to decrease the volume of opioids and number of overdoses within the state. If their policies effectively decrease opioid prescriptions and deaths, they can be used as justifications for, or frameworks of, future interventions.

## 2. Research Design

Two methods of analysis were used to evaluate the efficacy of states’ policy changes: a pre-post and difference-in-difference analysis. A pre-post analysis shows the effect of a policy change by measuring a variable’s trend before and after the change goes into effect. If the trend changes after the policy’s implementation year,the policy may have been effective. In the context of this analysis, pre-post graphs measure the number of opioid shipments or overdoses in a state’s counties before and after the state’s new opioid policy took effect. An effective policy would have a trend line that decreases in the years after the policy’s implementation. If the trend does not change, the policy may not be effective. 

The pre-post analysis is a useful tool, but it is not without shortcomings: it does not leave room for external context. Pre-post analyses cannot account for overarching trends or situations that may impact the measurement of interest. Thus, any observed changes actually caused by an outside factor may be misattributed to the policy. To combat this effect, a difference-in-difference (DD) analysis was used.

A DD analysis uses comparison regions over the same time period to provide a baseline trend. An effective policy would then have an effect above and beyond the trendline of comparison states. If an external factor affected trends in opioid shipments or deaths, this shock would likely be reflected in the target state and comparison states. For this analysis, states with similar pre-regulation trends were used as comparisons. Examining opioid shipments and overdoses trends before a state’s intervention and comparing them to the target states ensured that any observed effects were truly attributable to a policy change, and not external shocks.
